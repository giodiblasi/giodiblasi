# Hi, I'm Giovanni üññ
I'm a passionate software engineer!<br />
If you are looking for some interesting but not useful and not completed repo, this is the right place!<br />
I like to experiment with languages and technologies and here is where I have fun with code.

## Where you can find me üîç
Sometimes I write about tech stuff on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/giodiblasi).<br />
You can find more about me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/giovannidiblasi) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giovannidiblasi)<br />
And if you like recursion you can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/giodiblasi)
